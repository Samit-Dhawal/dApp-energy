## GunJS [gun.eco](https://gun.eco/docs/Introduction)
GUN is a small, easy, and fast protocol for syncing data. Because GUN is small, it can be added to your app to improve a single feature. But because GUN is easy, it can also replace hundreds or thousands of lines of code, networking calls, storage boilerplate, pub/sub routing, cache invalidation, and more. The power of GUN is that it abstracts this complexity into a unified simple API that is very different than traditional systems, with the aim of making it easy to build cool apps quickly.

## Project outline
This is a market place for selling and buying energy units from an online market. We have created the marketplace where a user will login and add what are there holding to the market, before the holdings are posted on the market, admin will have to approve the holding if found proper or else reject. Once a holding is approved by the admin, it will be avaiable to all other users in the market to buy. When someone will buy the holding the transactions will be saved in the mongodb database as well as the decentralized gunjs database.

The benefit of saving the transactions on the decentralized database is, none has the whole access on the data, and none can breach the security and access the database as the data is distributed into many nodes on the internet.
